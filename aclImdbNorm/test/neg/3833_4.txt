i just can't imagine any possible reasons why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. they got blackmailed maybe? or are they that badly out of money? the main problem with the movie is that it's boring. the conversations between madsen's and hopper's character are pointless, just like the bored chatting between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night. you never feel for any of the characters (although madsen's psycho killer is very likeable, comparing to the other characters). hopper always was a good actor, and madsen does a fine job as the serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost laughable. there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening, each of them last about three minutes. although the "talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers" scenes would have been interesting, if they were scenes in a book. the whole concept would've been interesting for a novel, but a movie just can't bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action.
