directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz. a young mother selma lidz(andie macdowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid(john tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son steven(nathan watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny(michael richards)and melvin(lou cutell)until his mom is well. steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz. set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. not being a macdowell fan, unstrung heroes assures my attitude; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.
