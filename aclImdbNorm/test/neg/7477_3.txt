maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late night's fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carson's show. carson daly can't hold a candle to leno, letterman, o'brien or any other late night talk show host, and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short. but, i wouldn't call it crap. carson daly is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great(that honesty is actually helpful here), while some of last call's skits and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. actually, some of carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.<br /><br />as an interviewer, carson is okay, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team. however, he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious. i do not like his musical guests, but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so, i'm not holding it against him.<br /><br />on to the house band. i don't know joe firstmans band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra, the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7. even cleeto and the cleetones are better. but, firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if anything, watch the show for him, i do.<br /><br />in summary, this show isn't even worth a full bag of kibble n' bits. but it does have an audience, and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". if you don't have cable and are up at 1:37 am, there really isn't much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse out there in that time frame. so, if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on, 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait.
