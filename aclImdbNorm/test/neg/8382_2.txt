while studying the differences between religion and cult in college, mindy (rachel miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) and morgan (victoria venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen quinlin (robert berson) twenty years ago in california. quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. however, after the death of morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.<br /><br />the storyline of 'cult" is not totally bad. unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the cgi and the edition are awful. i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd, but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a saturday night. my vote is two.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o amuleto secreto" ("the secret charm")
