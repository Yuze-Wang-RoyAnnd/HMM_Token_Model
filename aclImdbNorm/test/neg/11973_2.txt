wow! here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. if the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic "writing" sure will.<br /><br />a diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. need i say more? this movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with imovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night cinemax special. actually, thats not fair, as the actors didn't have much room to work around the abysmal script. parts of this movie really seem like parody, especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans, with the worst lip-synching ever performed to go along with it. the "gore" here is also a major disappointment. in most b-movies such as this, there is a thick layer of cheap gore fx to make up for what the story and acting lacks. here, the stuff is so cheap that it's not even fun. this movie actually makes "jack frost 2" look like lots of fun in comparison.<br /><br />if you think this movie is the "worst one you've ever seen" then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of straight-to-video b-horror. regardless, this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish, no matter what your background.
