the other is a supposed "horror" movie made during the 1970s. it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others, which starred nicole kidman.<br /><br />the plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as "the game". one of these twin boys - niles - is supposed to be "good". the other one - holland - is supposed to be evil.<br /><br />the idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel. i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end.<br /><br />the execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5. in fact, this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel. a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a u-rated movie of the kind disney produce. but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the other.<br /><br />you don't need to check out the director's cv to realise horror is not his forte.<br /><br />mr. mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story. this is obvious from the get-go. i haven't seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site. unfortunately in the other, the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect.<br /><br />the direction is as bland as you could possibly find. almost every single scene takes place in the daytime! think about this - a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area. does it sound scary or atmospheric? believe me, it isn't. it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie. and yes, both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california.<br /><br />there is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless.<br /><br />the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period. i won't reveal which movie but i'll give 2 clues - a young boy was a main character and the movie is well-known. and i'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie.<br /><br />the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars. the actors playing the twin boys, along with the actress playing the grandmother, all try hard with the poor material they are given.<br /><br />diana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys. do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list. she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash-in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers.<br /><br />i paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover (of the region 2 version in the uk). comparisons were made to the exorcist, which i thought was a complete insult to that movie. there is no comparison. the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not - suspense, tension, tongue-in-cheek humour, highly disturbing content, great acting, superb characterisation and viewer involvement. ironically, the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other. the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s!<br /><br />the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist, the omen, the texas chainsaw massacre, the legend of hell house, salem's lot to name just a few being produced. for this reason, the other proves an even greater disappointment.<br /><br />if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting, they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about. i would advice everyone to skip the movie.
