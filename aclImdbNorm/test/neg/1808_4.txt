after reading the book, heart of darkness, the movie did not do it justice. the movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie. in the film, the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie. the director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.<br /><br />of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. joseph conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. the movie doesn't even start to show any of this. some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out, like how kurtz was not in the boat when he died. also when marlow went to deliver the news to kurtz's intended, she reacted differently in the movie, rather than the book. another major difference was that marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie, not at the beginning, like the book. this was influential on how the audience perceived marlow, and the movie totally messed that up.<br /><br />the book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like, but the scenery in the movie was a let down. there was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment, a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. there was one exception to the awful actors and that would be isaach de bankol'e, who played mfumu. his character was depicted the best. though the movie wasn't that great, i still would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well. that way, you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. if you have not read the book, i do not recommend the movie because it is a boring, lifeless mess. i loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
