i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving. not only is it hokey, manipulative, and melodramatic. it's also shamelessly offensive. the character of radio `gooding jr.' is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal, like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home.' this mentality is shameless; radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience. even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments, in which radio gets hit in the head/trips/falls over/etc. these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because, `it's funny because radio is retarded' this is shameless, now i do not feel that the word `retarded' is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled, but this seems to be the stance the film is taking, `radio is retarded, but that's okay, because he's cute and we like him.' gooding's portrayal seems better suited for a john water's film than an inspiring family drama. to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level, debra winger is uninspired in the role as the `stereotypical housewives' that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film. the score by john horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography. ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film. in conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this travesty of a film, read the book, but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history.
