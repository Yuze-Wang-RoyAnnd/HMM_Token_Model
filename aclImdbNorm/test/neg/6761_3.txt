i first saw this movie at a saturday matinee when i was very young. i thought it was cool and often thought about it. well i finally resaw it on dvd. it was still very entertaining but in a different way. it has to rank as one of the goofiest, campiest, 1950's sci-fi movies. it seemed filled with stock military footage. the dialogue is stilted and effects are crude. there is one line of dialogue that had me in stitches. the line jeff morrow says while on the beach with the babe. rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. it is a classic.
