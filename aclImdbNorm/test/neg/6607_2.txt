there are three main problems with the film. or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration.<br /><br />firstly, and this was always going to be true, it's not nearly as good as the books. however, at least we could have expected to reflect some of the sapkowski's wit or depth.<br /><br />secondly we have the production. fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the hardest to produce well. everything from the props through costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) cgi is substandard.<br /><br />finally, and this is many be very subjective, i just can't quite take the acting seriously. i wasn't brought up in poland so i can't really judge- it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish. all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered... the casting could be better as well.<br /><br />in summation, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver.<br /><br />on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english. i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them... i would ask the english-speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book.
