another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner. technically, it's horrible. the acting is not too good either. but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). the ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. if you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. it's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. i'm sure there's a reason for that. for a while, it was titled hostage. it don't matter what you call it, it's still a poor choice for entertainment. it might be good for a mst3000 party or something. can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam? if that don't have exploitation written all over it, i'll eat my hat. i remember when this was shot in belmont, nc. a lot of local personalities were used as talent.
