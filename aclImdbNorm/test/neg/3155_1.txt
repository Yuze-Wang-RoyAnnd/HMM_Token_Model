barney and friends...the dora the explorer of the 1990s.<br /><br />ok, i'll admit it. as a kid, barney was my ultimate hero. i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape. maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mind-numbing.<br /><br />however, by the time i turned 7, i started to hate barney. everyone at school would dis barney, and i went along with it (mainly because it was funny) and it's what little boys do. but a few years later, i discovered something else about barney that i will never forget.<br /><br />a person known on the imdb as angel_meiru did an essay for school, explaining the dangers of watching barney, and he or she posted it in the message boards. a lot of those dangers made sense.<br /><br />barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school. he is supposedly educational, or so sheryl leach (barney's creator) says, but really, all i can remember him teaching me, is that magic can solve anything, which is not true.<br /><br />to end off this comment, i'd like to tell you a little story. there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney. one day, he was alone, when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him. i don't know the outcome (but it's safe to assume the child died) but why was he abducted in the first place? because he watched the barney and friends episode titled "a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet." <br /><br />0/10
