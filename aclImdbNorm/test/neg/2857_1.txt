i have never seen a b movie like this one... on the part that the nanny sofia is being killed... a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick... how bad is that??? lol, i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie, but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse...lol...it is bad for itself... poor pinocchio.. the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of pinocchio's face moving... apart from that the whole movie is awful... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare! but if you have nothing to do... go on... treat yourself with some "z" movie cos b-movie is still too good for this one...lol
