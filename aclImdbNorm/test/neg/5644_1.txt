the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but i'm afraid is miscast, vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch. in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer (greyhounds to be precise),who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior. i'm sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish. trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames. he takes on the role of policeman, whilst the real police are bit part players, interceeding with flashbacks from charles dickens.<br /><br />when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does'nt in this part need act tough, snarling at the camera in parts. if you watch the mean machine, he is perfectly cast, and believable and does a very decent performance. <br /><br />getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day, these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used. <br /><br />the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times, and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of vinnies love interest, she starts the film as a detecive, but quickly becomes the girlfriend.<br /><br />the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet/not answered . strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie.<br /><br />vinnie, is slowly becoming britans steven segal, stick to the supporting actor role, your'e quite good at it.
