'helen of troy' follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war. this is more of a love story between helen and paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen. the film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together. (other films and books have different portrayals of the characters, but in this one, they are simply hopelessly in love.) the film is pretty slow-moving in some places, but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well. there are also some good performances. i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job, and she was one of the most well-liked characters.<br /><br />overall, this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow-moving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue. in my opinion, a perfect iliad film version has not yet been created, but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits.
