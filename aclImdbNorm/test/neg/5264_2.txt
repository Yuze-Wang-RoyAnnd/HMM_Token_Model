to keep from being bored during "love and sex," first i tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of: "breaking up" with russell crowe and salma hayek (though that had a more original ending), "about last night" with rob lowe, and a lot of tv shows. <br /><br />second was admiring just how gorgeous framke janssen is so i couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other? <br /><br />third was trying to figure out why the writer/director bothered to give jon favreau's character the jewish name of adam levy; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.<br /><br />fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater.<br /><br />(originally written 9/2/2000)
