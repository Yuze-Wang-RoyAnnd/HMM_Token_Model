this movie can't decide what it is -- a soft porno or a sf movie. not enough plot for a real movie, but way too much for a porno.<br /><br />in a galaxy far far away, a good princess (we know she's good because she has long blonde hair, wears a white toga, is polite, and is mooning wistfully about her dying mother when we first see her) inherits the kingdom over her elder sister, who is evil (and we know this because she has dark hair and wears too much makeup, abuses her male sexual slaves, sneers and curls her lip all the time, and talks imperiously about the horrors she'll perpetrate when she's queen). the evil princess gets upset and tries to stage a coup, but the good sister gets away to earth. of course, she materializes buck naked in a bar during a wet t-shirt contest. it really goes downhill from there. the acting is ludicrous, the dialog sounds like it was written for a porno, and the general storyline is ridiculous. there's not even enough skin to make happy the sort of person who'd watch this for skin. i love "good" bad movies, and this one's not even enjoyable on a "bad movie" level.
